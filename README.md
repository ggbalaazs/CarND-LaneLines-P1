# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**
---

### Overview

This project is about identifying lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. The pipeline uses basic concepts like thresholding, blurring, region-of-interest masking, Canny edge detection and Hough line detection. It should be tested on three  video files with similar road conditions and perspectives.


### Requirements

- Jupyter notebook: lane_detection.ipynb
- Project writeup: writeup.md
